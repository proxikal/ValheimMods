### QOLMod requires BepInEx.Configuration to work properly.
> You can download it at the NexusMods valheim site.
  
### All features displayed below can be toggled on or off at anytime using **F1**
  
I don't have the time at the moment to write everything down on the **0.10.1** update  
I will edit this a little later, for now I'll explain the Sign and Chest feature  
that allows chests to act as a smelter with new recipes below!  
  
Step 1 -> Enable SaC in the configuration file or by pressing F1  
Step 2 -> Once in the game place a chest down (works best on a wooden pole)  
Step 3 -> Place a sign as close to the chest as possible  
Step 4 -> Place the rquired items of whatever recipe you want and watch it go!
  
Now Here are the current recipes available to be made through SaC:
